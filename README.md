Introduction/Context: 
Video games inhabit a unique space as an artistic medium, being something that requires user participation in order to fulfill the promise of an experience being offered. This makes the relationship that the player has with the game especially much more intrinsic to the medium as compared to any other art form, and hence worth exploring.

Related Work:
There are multiple examples of video games that explore the relationship between the player and the game world that the player character inhabits, such as The Stanley Parable, or Undertale. They allow the player to explore the nature of storytelling through video games by narratively commenting on the relationship that the player has with the game by “allowing” the player to explore paths that aren’t explicitly outlined by the game. These games also place the player entirely as their own entity, acknowledging the player not as a character that they are embodying within the game, but simply as the player itself.

Problem Statement/Gap:
When a player embodies a character that isn’t explicitly expressed as the player, they are in a sense assuming a level of agency as the player character. When a user plays minecraft, they don’t exist in the world of minecraft as themselves, but as Steve/Alex. Yet, the player isn’t Steve. The player is the player. As far as we’re aware, there aren’t really any video games that explicitly address this distinction between the player and the character that the player embodies within the game, and the loss of agency that must in turn befall the character that acts as the player surrogate within the game world.

Solution:
To make a game that explores this relationship between the player and the character they embody within the game.
The game would follow a simple sprite that must navigate through procedurally generated mazes in order to achieve some arbitrary prize. As the game progresses, the player is given opportunities to manipulate game design elements to change how the character they’re playing as is able to interact with the game world.
Everytime the player changes parts of the game, slowly the character they’re playing as stops responding to user input until eventually, the character takes complete control away from the user and contemplates the purpose of being made to solve mazes for some arbitrary prize.

Validation:
By making a game like this, we hope the player would be confronted with their role in a video game as someone who inhabits a particular character within the game and taking complete control over them. By having the player slowly begin to struggle for control with not just the game, but the character itself, we hope the player would start to question the agency of the character that lies external to themselves as the player, as well as their own position within the game space as an entity that takes control over the character.
