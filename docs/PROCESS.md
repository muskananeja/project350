Behold, the process journal of Look Back; a humble group with a simple goal: to have fun with the Software Design Group Project. This document chronicles the trials and tribulations our group has gone through to ultimately get us to where we are right now. From moments of arguing over mechanics to points where we all stared at a computer screen with awe at the newest implementation, Look Back has gone through a lot to construct our final project: A game designed to dissociate the player from the character they’re playing as. Here is our journey to get there:


## 1st meeting (deciding our name):

The aim of this meeting was twofold:
1) Pick a name for the group
2) Discuss ideas we had for what we could do for the final project

This led us to two approaches to trying to identify a good team name:
- Off the cuff ideas
- Trying to find a name based on a project we all thought was interesting
The off-the-cuff ideas approach was jovial in nature. We suggested names based on things that were in our line of sight or stuff that sounded neat. This approach didn’t seem to be leading to any consensus.

The second approach gave us a bit more direction because by focusing on the project ideas we had, we also inevitably started discussing our hopes and expectations for what we wanted from the Software Design Project. 

At some point, the idea of making a video game was pitched, and that seemed to generate excitement from all of us. The video game idea made us realize:
- We wanted to work on something primarily creative
- We didn’t want to make a product that had to justify its existence or utility
- A video game seemed like something fun to work on
Using that project idea as a starting point, we started thinking about group names that matched our hopes and dreams for the project. 

At last, we settled on our final name: Look Back

The name was suggested based on the following features:
- It’s the name of a oneshot manga about two artists and the power of stories
- Encapsulated the idea of storytelling and doing something creative
- Was akin to the process of working things out, ie. looking back and seeing where else we could go
- It also sounded pretty cool
While we still weren’t 100% committed to making a video game, we left our first meeting having successfully named ourselves. It was a great start to our project.
